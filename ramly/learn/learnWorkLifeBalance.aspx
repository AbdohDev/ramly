      <h2><b>1. Lunch break Workout</b></h2>
      <p>Most peoples' excuses are that they work a full-time job or they have class from morning till night, but they never thought of including workout into their work time/study time. Mid-day lunch break is the best time to do so, even if you only have one hour of break. Do a minimum of 15 min workout, shower, and have the rest of the time to have your lunch. Plus, it will help you mentally push through the second half of the day.</p>
      <span>Tip: Do short intensive workout with little to no rest in between sets.</span>

      <h2><b>2. Natural Exercise </b></h2>
      <p>Creating a more active lifestyle can help when getting to the gym is impossible.
          Walk or bike to work, to school, to your errands, or even to leisure spots. This gives you enough physical activity without impeding on your normally busy daily routine. If time allows it, you can also incorporate more walking in your morning commute by getting off a stop or two earlier, then walking the rest of the way. You can also try taking the stairs more often as opposed to elevators or stairs.
      </p>
      <span>Even if you have no time to go to the gym,incorporating these activities will make you physically more active throughout the day.</span>

      <h2><b>3. Weekend Warrior</b></h2>
      <p>Weekdays too busy? No problem, let's grind in the weekend! If your circumstances stops you from working out entirely during the weekdays, take your weekends to push harder. Instead of squeezing time, you can have a longer workout, which also means that you can increase the intensity.</p>
      <span>Tip: As you have more time to do workouts during the weekend, increase your training volume so that the effect is more lasting throughout the following weekdays.</span>

      <h2><b>4. Ask your colleagues/Classmates</b></h2>
      <p>If you can't seem to figure out a way to fit in physical activites into your lifestyle, ask the people around you. Your colleagues/classmates that exercises may have a similar schedule with you, so asking how they fit in exercise may help you tremendously. You may even end up tagging along to a gym and create your own fitness cicrcle.</p>
