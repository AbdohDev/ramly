  <h2 id="pullup">Pull up</h2>
  <img src="/Images/workouts/pullup.jpg" />
  <p>Targeted Muscles: Shoulers, Back</p><p>Go down and lay your hands beside your chest. The closer your hand is to your chest, the more you will target the triceps, and lesser of the chest muscles. Start from the top and lower your body until your chest is few inches close to the floor. Begin to push your body back up while maintaining a straight body.</p>
  <br />
  <h2 id="chinup">Chin up</h2>
  <img src="/Images/workouts/chinup.png" />
  <p>Targeted Muscles: Shoulder, Bicep, Back</p><p>Stand up with a slighty wide foot-stance. Begin squatting down, swinging your arms to the front. Make sure you squat until your knees are about 90 degrees like the figure above. Push back up and swing your arms back to your sides.</p>
  <br />
  <h2 id="legraise">Leg Raise</h2>
  <img src="/Images/workouts/dipbarlegraise.jpeg" />
  <p>Targeted Muscles: Lower abs, Quadriceps</p><p>If you do not have a dip bar, just hang regularly on a bar and drive your legs in front of you together without rocking your upperbody too much. Straighten your legs to increase the difficulty.</p>
  <br />
  <h2 id="dips">Bar Dips (Dip Bar required*)</h2>
  <img src="/Images/workouts/dips.jpg" />
  <p>Targeted Muscles: Tricep, Lower chest, Back</p><p>Position the bars in a way that they are slightly wider than shoulder width. Start from to the top and go down until the position like the figure above. Push yourself back up with your body facing down to prevent unecessary tension on the shoulder joints.</p>
  <br />
  <h2 id="triceppushdown">Tricep pushdown</h2>
  <img src="/Images/workouts/triceppush.jpeg" />
  <p>Targeted Muscles: Tricep</p><p>Start like the figure above, with your body straight and your elbows bent under the bar. Begin to push your body up without moving your lower body.</p>
